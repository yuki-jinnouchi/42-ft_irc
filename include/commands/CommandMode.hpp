    Command: MODE
    Parameters: <channel> {[+|-]|o|p|s|i|t|n|b|v} [<limit>] [<user>]
                [<ban mask>]

    The MODE command is provided so that channel operators may change the
    characteristics of `their' channel.  It is also required that servers
    be able to change channel modes so that channel operators may be
    created.

    The various modes available for channels are as follows:

            o - give/take channel operator privileges;
            p - private channel flag;
            s - secret channel flag;
            i - invite-only channel flag;
            t - topic settable by channel operator only flag;
            n - no messages to channel from clients on the outside;
            m - moderated channel;
            l - set the user limit to channel;
            b - set a ban mask to keep users out;
            v - give/take the ability to speak on a moderated channel;
            k - set a channel key (password).

    When using the 'o' and 'b' options, a restriction on a total of three
    per mode command has been imposed.  That is, any combination of 'o'
    and
